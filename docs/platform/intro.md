# The DryEyeNet Plaform

DryEyeNet is a comprehensive system designed to cover everything required for the successful documentation of DEWS III–compliant dry eye patients. It includes all the capabilities of a full co-management system, together with integrated diagnostic device interfaces.

Each user is granted access to a subset of functionality based on their role and privileges. As a result, all access is hierarchized and compliant with the strictest legal and operational policies.

Each type of center—**Pre-Treatment Center**, **Reading Center**, and **Care Provider Center**—performs a specific set of tasks according to its workflow. Following the DryEyeNet STFD approach, each user or center is granted access only to the tasks they are expected to perform.

The default DryEyeNet presets are:

- **Pre-Treatment Center**
- **Reading Center**
- **Care Provider Center**
- **Patient Portal** (exclusively for patients)
