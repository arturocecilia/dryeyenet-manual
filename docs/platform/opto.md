# DryEyeNet OPTO

DryEyeNet OPTO is designed for use by Pre-Treatment Centers. However, depending on the specific workflows and regulatory requirements of each country, the set of accessible tasks can be extended to include additional steps along the dry eye care pathway.

By default, it includes the following tasks:

- [**New Base Survey**](/docs/new-base-survey/intro)
- [**New Base Exam**](/docs/new-base-exam/intro)
- **Device Import**
