Within the **Patient Dashboard**, you have access to all actions that can be performed for a patient:

- `INVITE TO PATIENT PORTAL`
- `VIEW PATIENT DOCUMENTATION`
- `REQUEST TREATMENT PLAN`

By clicking an action, it is either performed directly or a new screen opens with the corresponding action selected.
