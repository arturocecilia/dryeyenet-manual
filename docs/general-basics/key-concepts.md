# Key Concepts

DryEyeNet organizes work into guided flows called **workflows**:

- **New Base Exam** — baseline documentation (patient data, medication, anamnesis, questionnaires, and attachments).
- **New Treatment** — documentation of a performed treatment visit (typically requires an existing exam).
- …

Each **workflow** consists of sequential steps. A **Cancel** button is available throughout the flow to safely abort the process and return to the [**Main Menu**](/docs/general-basics/main-menu).

**Terms used in this manual:**

- **Step:** a single screen within a workflow.
- **Substep:** a dialog or nested screen within a step (e.g., _Add patient_).
- **Review:** the final step where you confirm data completeness before saving.

# Access, Roles, and Permissions

The system is role-based. Depending on the role you are assigned:

- Some menu entries may be hidden.
- Some steps may be read-only.
- Some actions (e.g., treatment planning) may be restricted.

If you do not see a feature described in this manual, please check your role permissions with your administrator.
