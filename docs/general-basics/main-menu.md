# Main Menu

After signing in, you will land on the **Main Menu**. The tiles displayed depend on your role and your office context.

**Practical notes:**

- Use **Cancel** to exit any workflow and return to the Main Menu.
- Use this screen as your stable starting point between patients.
- If a workflow tile is missing, it is usually due to a role or permission issue.
