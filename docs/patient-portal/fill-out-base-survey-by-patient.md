# Patients Can Fill Out Their Base Survey

When patients log in with their credentials and have a [**Base Survey**] assigned, it will immediately appear and be ready to be completed.

If they cancel it at that moment, they can still continue filling it out later by clicking the **Base Survey** card from the main menu:
