# Patient Management

You can **create** and **edit** patients from more than one location within **DryEyeNet**.

- **Patient Dashboard**

  The most straightforward way is to access the [**Patient Dashboard**](/docs/patient-dashboard/intro). In the bottom menu, you will find the option to **Add a new patient**.  
  To edit an existing patient, first select the patient; the **Edit** option will then appear in the bottom menu.

  Please note that in **DryEyeNet**, each patient has their own user account for accessing the Patient Portal.

After clicking the Patient Dashboard option:

Once a patient is selected, all available actions for that patient will be displayed:

- **Substeps in Workflows**

  When creating a new [**New Base Survey**](/docs/new-base-survey/intro), the first step is to select an existing patient or **Add patient** (create a new one).  
  This provides direct access to the option to create a patient from the bottom menu.
