# Give Access to the Patient Portal

After creating the patient, you can invite them to the Patient Portal by clicking `INVITE TO THE PATIENT PORTAL` in the [**Patient Dashboard**](/docs/patient-dashboard/intro).

![Bottom Menu in the Patient Dashboard](/img/patient-portal/patPor_giveAccess_en.png)

When you click this option, an email is sent to the address provided during the [patient creation process](/docs/patient-management/create-patient).

The email contains a secure link that directs the patient to a form where they can set up their access details and activate their Patient Portal account.
