# Documenting a Treatment

You can access `New Treatment` from the **Main Menu**:

![New Treatment in the Main Menu](/img/new-treatment/newTre_maiMen_en.png)

Each treatment record is linked to a previously assigned [**Treatment Plan**](/docs/new-treatment-plan/intro).

To document a treatment:

1. Select the patient.
2. Select the treatment plan assigned to the patient.
3. Complete the treatment documentation.

The sections available in the treatment documentation depend on the selected treatment plan.
