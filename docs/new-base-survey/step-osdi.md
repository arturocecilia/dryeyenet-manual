# Step 3: OSDI Questionnaire

The OSDI questionnaire provides standardized documentation of symptom severity.

> **Recommendation:** Prefer completion via the [Patient Portal](/docs/patient-portal/intro) whenever possible (better patient comfort and fewer time constraints). If completed in the portal, confirm that the results are visible and avoid re-entering the answers.
